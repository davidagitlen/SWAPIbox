##Overview
SWAPIbox is a one-week paired project for front-end engineering students at the Turing School of Software and design.

The goal of the project is to fetch (sometimes nested) data -- a film, people, planets, and vehicles -- from the Star Wars API and display it using class and functional React components. 

The project also serves as an introduction to React Router to make it dynamic as well as propTypes to ensure each component is receiving the correct type of props.
